# Fantasy Novel Generator

## [NaNoGenMo 2018](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2018)

This project generates a fantasy novel that consists of a protagonist building a party, traveling through various lands, encountering and fighting monsters, enjoying times at taverns, and finally reaching the realm of the dreaded antagonist. They fight the antagonist and save their world. The fights and tavern times use generated personalities and stats to help decide how the characters interact and behave, and "languages" are generated for each fantasy race.

As of November 27, 2018, I am submitting this as is for NaNoGenMo, and a sample output is contained in the [`novel.txt`](./novel.txt) file.

You can generate your own by cloning/downloading the repo, navigating to the folder in your favorite command line interface (I use PowerShell or bash depending on what computer I'm using), and running `node index.js`. It'll overwrite the `novel.txt` file, so if you got an output you really like, move the existing `novel.txt` file somewhere else first.

I'm hoping to continue working on this to add all the extra bits and pieces and possibilities that I wanted to add for each different location type and also include situational rising and falling moods with middle chapters and other events to make it more fantasy-like, but since I started in the middle of the month, I only had time to add fights and tavern games. In the next version, I intend to at least have treasure hunting and dungeon delving plus middle chapters and more possibilities and interactions for the final chapter.

Until then, I hope you enjoy the (repetitive) adventures of your generated heroes! (At least check out the first chapter, some of the middle ones, and the ending to get a gist of what happens during the rest of the middle of the novel :slightly_smiling_face: ).
