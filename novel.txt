"Lei iowou aosuiyuicaa wasaifou, aosuiyuicaa faisaiyeo huoseas eafaacoufiih eoyueceiya ailoufioyoih hui."
―Louwuukuu Hosauhao, great elf queen
~~~~~~~~

When Eizloifristoi Biuchoi, the evil, overtook the citadel of Joihibiu with their horrible army, Oacuu suffered a horrible loss. News about Eizloifristoi Biuchoi, the evil, reached the homeland of Afoif Koyeokaul slowly over a series of updates. Feeling sympathetic toward the plight of Oacuu, the dagger warrior set out to help.

Afoif was a feminine elf who was about 6 feet and 3 inches tall and wore orange-and-orange chain mail with a maroon skirt and blue-and-purple hair on her head and was a user of the dagger. Knowing that the evil and their army could never be defeated alone, Afoif decided that she will need at least 3 other brave souls to assist her. Fortunately, she knew she could count on at least 2 friends to come help her on her journey.

Afoif skipped to Oiyaciiwue, the elf dagger-learner's, shack to request their assistance. Ever eager to help, the masculine elf who was about 5 feet and 8 inches tall and wore tan leather armor with a tan-and-black loincloth and an orange-and-purple floppy hat on his head agreed to join Afoif.

"This is a good thing we are setting out to do," Oiyaciiwue chirped.

"You are so wonderful! I am so excited to travel with you and help the people of Oacuu," Afoif beamed.

Finally, Afoif skipped to Ecoc, the human dagger-learner's, cabin to request their assistance. Though incredulous at the mere suggestion, the masculine human who was about 5 feet and 1 inch tall and wore a brown shirt with a tan loincloth agreed to join Afoif.

"I hope you don't get us all killed," Ecoc yelled.

"Don't you worry, sour puss. This will be a great experience, and we will help many people!" Afoif beamed.

While 2 friends is great, Afoif knew that she still needed 1 more person to help. So Afoif skipped to her local gathering place with her friends to find some more assistance.

Afoif moved to the center of the gathering place and announced, "I am Afoif of the Koyeokaul clan. It's a pleasure to meet you! I have heard of Eizloifristoi Biuchoi's treachery, and I want to do something to help Oacuu! we need more friends to help us!"

A masculine human who was about 5 feet and 2 inches tall and wore purple chain mail with a tan skirt stood and said, "I am Iogalou of the Iomowouj clan. I am a master of the bow."

Though hesitant at first, he agreed to join Afoif.

"I hope we are able to do some good," Iogalou said.

"Thank you so much! This will bring much peace to many people," Afoif beamed.

Having gathered enough friends to begin her journey, Afoif sets out from her large and dirty home in the mountain of Flufla with her newly-assembled party to brave the dangers on the way to the lair of the evil...

Our heroes explored the forest of Soil, a huge and sunny place with busy thickets and deteriorating leaves. They were in the grove called "Cueleikoal", seeing what they could find.

As they were exploring, Afoif saw an imp! She kept it to herself, opting to run in and destroy it alone instead of alerting anyone else.

Afoif stepped up to attack the imp with her dagger... Afoif stabbed the imp and the imp let out a cry of pain. The imp recklessly moved to attack Iogalou with a poke... Iogalou tried to dodge, but the imp was too fast! But it missed! Iogalou stepped up to attack the imp with his bow... But he missed! Oiyaciiwue looked around and decided to attack the imp with his dagger... But he missed! Ecoc lost his nerve and ran a little distance away. 

The imp got spooked and ran away to avoid dying! 

The party gathered itself together in victory, continuing their trek onward.

Our heroes rested at the plains called Oisuucaofoi, a small and stony place with grimy fields. They were in the field called "Iifaohoacu", recovering from all the walking they had done.

The party set up camp and rested for the night. Our heroes explored the mountain of Iostiegl, a cramped and pleasant place with colorful peaks and bleak cliffs. They were on the path called "Prieprush", seeing what they could find.

Not encountering anything interesting, the party continues onward. The party returned to the city called Ietwioglio, a small and shimmering place with grim walkways. They were in the specialty shop called "The Weak Sniper", recovering from all the walking they had done.

The party walked into the pleasing specialty shop and saw that there were 1 person there plus the bartender. 

Oiyaciiwue felt thirsty and approached the bar, saying, "May I please have your best beer!"

The bartender nodded, poured a pint of the Single Advertisement beer and slid it over to Oiyaciiwue. Oiyaciiwue downed it, nodding in satisfaction. The Single Advertisement turned out to be too much for him, and he got drunk as he continued drinking. He looked over and saw a masculine orc who was about 6 feet tall and wore maroon chain mail with brown-and-orange pants and a yellow floppy hat on his head. Oiyaciiwue walked over to pick a fight.

"I am Oiyaciiwue of the Kaif clan. It's a pleasure to meet you! I am a learner of the dagger, and I think we should fight!" Oiyaciiwue boasted.

"Well, I am Livoza of the Blosa clan. It's a pleasure to meet you! And I am a master of the quarterstaff, and I accept your challenge!" Oiyaciiwue retorted.

Oiyaciiwue took a defensive stance to try to fend off the enemy's advance. Livoza recklessly moved to attack Oiyaciiwue with his quarterstaff... But he couldn't hit Oiyaciiwue!

"Ah! This place is still so great!" Afoif giggled, turning in a circle to take in the tavern.

"Well well, it's Afoif! Didn't expect to see you around. How are things?" Iizeucheo grunted.

"Iizeucheo! I'm so happy you're here! The journey is going well." Afoif replied.

Ecoc noticed a male goblin who was about 3 feet and 3 inches tall and wore a brown shirt with a white loincloth and white locks on his head sitting at a table with a deck of cards. Ecoc walked over to request a game.

"I am Oegruocoubr of the Oismou clan. It's a pleasure to meet you! Sit down and we can get started," Oegruocoubr smirked, "We're playing Splits."

Ecoc shuffled the deck and dealt the cards. Ecoc laid down his cards: the 2 of swords and the 2 of shields and the 4 of shields. Oegruocoubr laid down his cards: the 1 of shields and the 1 of stars and the 5 of stars. So Ecoc won!

Oiyaciiwue wanted to get drunk and approached the bar, saying, "May I please have your strongest wine!"

The tavern keeper nodded, poured a pint of the Jubilant Objectification wine and slid it over to Oiyaciiwue. Oiyaciiwue downed it, nodding in satisfaction.

"I am Houluuhaih of the Oifa clan. Sit down and we can get started," Houluuhaih smirked, "We're playing Splits."

Houluuhaih shuffled the deck and dealt the cards. Afoif looked at her cards, thought for a moment, and discarded her 2 of stars to draw a new one, and laid down her cards: the 3 of shields and the 3 of stars and the 5 of shields. Houluuhaih laid down her cards: the 1 of shields and the 5 of stars and the 5 of swords. Which means Houluuhaih won!

Iogalou noticed a nonbinary human who was about 5 feet and 9 inches tall and wore maroon leather armor with a white-and-purple loincloth sitting at a table with a set of dice. Iogalou walked over to request a game.

"I am Aexiokrouto of the Kor clan. Not that I care what you think. Sit down and we can get started," Aexiokrouto smirked, "We're playing Overpower."

Iogalou gathered up the dice into the cup. Aexiokrouto starts the game by rolling a 2. Iogalou rolled a 5, which beat the previously-rolled 2. Aexiokrouto rolled a 5, which did not beat the previously-rolled 5, knocking Aexiokrouto out of the game! Which means that Iogalou won the game!
