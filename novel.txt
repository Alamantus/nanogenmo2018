"Uyes, yeuraobiim uesed eobiay uyes iusoil eobiay iusoil Ceikue saok kiadiub?"
―Moiluu Ousoil, beloved elf queen
~~~~~~~~

A storm has been brewing in the dark realm of Sradom. Rumors of Ijadlo Trothosrox, the destroyer of worlds, building a fierce army have been spreading, and the realm of Shishou was stricken with fear. Eachaejee Igu, a fledgling bow-learner, was in her cosy shack when they heard about the threat of the destroyer of worlds, Ijadlo Trothosrox, and she felt a drive to do something about it.

Eachaejee was a female dwarf who was about 4 feet and 1 inch tall and wore tan leather armor with yellow greaves and was a learner of the bow. Knowing that the destroyer of worlds and her army could never be defeated alone, Eachaejee decided that she will need at least 3 other brave souls to assist her. Fortunately, she knew she could count on at least 3 friends to come help her on her journey.

Eachaejee meandered to Oumeisuemue, the elf bow-user's, cabin to request their assistance. Ever eager to help, the masculine elf who was about 6 feet and 6 inches tall and wore a green blouse with white-and-maroon shorts agreed to join Eachaejee.

"This is a good thing we are setting out to do," Oumeisuemue smiled.

"Maybe so, but it won't be a comfortable journey. Get ready for a hard ride," Eachaejee frowned in reply.

Next, Eachaejee meandered to Flaecreagootr, the dwarf sword-learner's, hovel to request their assistance. Though incredulous at the mere suggestion, the nonbinary dwarf who was about 4 feet and 9 inches tall and wore brown chain mail with a purple skirt agreed to join Eachaejee.

"I hope you don't get us all killed," Flaecreagootr grumbled.

"Yeah me too, but if we don't do something, we'll be in deep trouble!" Eachaejee frowned in reply.

Finally, Eachaejee meandered to Poohudric, the dwarf sword-learner's, house to request their assistance. Ever eager to help, the female dwarf who was about 4 feet and 9 inches tall and wore red chain mail with black-and-red shorts and a maroon helmet on her head agreed to join Eachaejee.

"This is a good thing we are setting out to do," Poohudric smiled.

"Maybe so, but it won't be a comfortable journey. Get ready for a hard ride," Eachaejee frowned in reply.

Having gathered enough friends to begin her journey, Eachaejee sets out from her small and hidden home in the forest called Zica with her newly-assembled party to brave the dangers on the way to the lair of the destroyer of worlds...

Our heroes moved on from where they were in the forest called Zica, a small and hidden place with mysterious leaves and thickets. They were in the grove called "Aplia", recovering from all the walking they had done.

The party set up camp and rested for the night. Our heroes walked through the city of Craehobl, a large and shady place with serene walkways and streets. They were at the inn called "The Lumbering Snowman", trying to make their way through.

"Ziacrec iklaplecia iaweesish iapraiklia greeweegri breeklipra trihishiac pleeyeye neeyiaveesh asepe ivaiplia prapenaz epriageeg, iareceeda?"
―Xairi Wabria, great human ruler
~~~~~~~~

Our heroes rested at the city of Ishasra, a large and muddy place with ornate houses. They were in the specialty shop called "The Giddy Farmer", recovering from all the walking they had done.

The party walked into the neglected specialty shop and found 3 people there plus the bartender. Ospeashee Heacro, the bartender, saw Eachaejee and her friends walk in.

"Well well, it's Eachaejee! Didn't expect to see you around. How are things?" Ospeashee grunted.

"Ha! Ospeashee! What are you even still doing here? You shoulda gotten outta here when you had a chance! The journey is going well." Eachaejee replied.

Oumeisuemue felt thirsty and approached the bar, saying, "May I please have your best wine!"

The bartender nodded, poured a pint of the Grubby Charity wine and slid it over to Oumeisuemue. Oumeisuemue downed it, nodding in satisfaction. 

Eachaejee noticed a female dwarf who was about 4 feet and 8 inches tall and wore brown leather armor with black-and-maroon pants sitting at a table with a set of dice. Eachaejee walked over to request a game.

"I am Ceacoo of the Ouswoucrae clan. Sit down and we can get started," Ceacoo smirked, "We're playing Overpower."

Ceacoo gathered up the dice into the cup. Eachaejee starts the game by rolling a 1. Ceacoo rolled a 1, which did not beat the previously-rolled 1, knocking Ceacoo out of the game! Which means that Eachaejee won the game!

Poohudric noticed a female dwarf who was about 4 feet and 8 inches tall and wore brown leather armor with black-and-maroon pants sitting at a table with a set of dice. Poohudric walked over to request a game.

"I am Ceacoo of the Ouswoucrae clan. Sit down and we can get started," Ceacoo smirked, "We're playing Sets."

Poohudric gathered up the dice into the cup. Poohudric laid down her cards: the 1 of swords and the 1 of shields and the 4 of stars. Ceacoo looked at her cards, thought for a moment, and discarded her 3 of swords to draw a new one, and laid down her cards: the 4 of swords and the 5 of shields and the 5 of stars. So Ceacoo won!

Flaecreagootr noticed a masculine human who was about 5 feet tall and wore brown chain mail with maroon pants and a blue helmet on his head sitting at a table with a deck of cards. Flaecreagootr walked over to request a game.

"I am Aishiasigre of the Creetraihapr clan. Nice to meet you! Sit down and we can get started," Aishiasigre smirked, "We're playing Splits."

Flaecreagootr shuffled the deck and dealt the cards. Flaecreagootr looked at their cards, thought for a moment, and discarded their 1 of shields to draw a new one, and laid down their cards: the 3 of shields and the 4 of stars and the 2 of swords. Aishiasigre looked at his cards, thought for a moment, and discarded his 2 of shields to draw a new one, and laid down his cards: the 3 of swords and the 4 of shields and the 5 of swords. Which means Flaecreagootr won!

"Heh, well, it's not pretty, but it's definitely a tavern," Eachaejee chuckled.

The party returned to the city of Ishasra, a large and muddy place with ornate houses. They were in the bar called "The Tepid Horsewoman", trying to make their way through.

The party walked into the deficient bar and found 3 people there plus the bartender. 

Poohudric wanted to get drunk and approached the bar, saying, "May I please have your strongest wine!"

The bartender nodded, poured a pint of the Stupid Misogyny wine and slid it over to Poohudric. Poohudric downed it, nodding in satisfaction. The Stupid Misogyny turned out to be too much for her, and she got drunk as she continued drinking. She looked over and saw a male human who was about 5 feet and 4 inches tall and wore tan chain mail with red shorts. Poohudric walked over to pick a fight.

"I am Poohudric of the Fovifl clan. Nice to meet you! I am a learner of the sword, and I think we should fight!" Poohudric boasted.

"Well, I am Repina of the Tap clan. And I am a learner of the bow, and I accept your challenge!" Poohudric retorted.

Poohudric lost her nerve and ran a little distance away. Repina looked around and decided to attack Poohudric with his bow... But he couldn't hit Poohudric! 

Repina took a defensive stance to try to fend off the enemy's advance. Poohudric recklessly moved to attack Repina with her sword... Repina tried to dodge, but Poohudric was too fast! Poohudric cut Repina, but it didn't hurt very much; Repina brushed off the attack like a pro. Poohudric cut Repina a second time, doing a fair amount of damage; Repina tried to brush off the attack, but it was clear that he felt the pain. 

Repina became afraid and ran away before the party could finish him off!

Oumeisuemue felt thirsty and approached the bar, saying, "May I please have your best ale!"

The bartender nodded, poured a pint of the Gracious History ale and slid it over to Oumeisuemue. Oumeisuemue downed it, nodding in satisfaction. The Gracious History turned out to be too much for him, and he got drunk as he continued drinking. 

Eachaejee noticed a feminine orc who was about 6 feet and 7 inches tall and wore a tan blouse with a white loincloth sitting at a table with a set of dice. Eachaejee walked over to request a game.

"I am Esralejo of the Blathidopl clan. Nice to meet you! Sit down and we can get started," Esralejo smirked, "We're playing Sets."

Esralejo gathered up the dice into the cup. Eachaejee laid down her cards: the 3 of stars and the 5 of stars and the 5 of swords. Esralejo laid down her cards: the 2 of swords and the 2 of shields and the 4 of stars. Which means Eachaejee won!

"I am Eemrou of the Iglusrufl clan. It's a pleasure to meet you! Sit down and we can get started," Eemrou smirked, "We're playing Conquer."

"Heh, well, it's not pretty, but it's definitely a tavern," Eachaejee chuckled.

"Eachaejee! What a surprise! I trust things are going well?" Riumiibou smiled.

"Ha! Riumiibou! What are you even still doing here? You shoulda gotten outta here when you had a chance! The journey is going well." Eachaejee replied.

Oumeisuemue noticed a masculine human who was about 5 feet tall and wore a red-and-yellow shirt with purple greaves and a purple-and-maroon floppy hat on his head sitting at a table with a set of dice. Oumeisuemue walked over to request a game.

"I am Metweeklai of the Siash clan. Sit down and we can get started," Metweeklai smirked, "We're playing Overpower."

Eachaejee wanted to get drunk and approached the bar, saying, "Get me your strongest wine!"

The tavern keeper nodded, poured a pint of the Weighty Isolation wine and slid it over to Eachaejee. Eachaejee downed it, nodding in satisfaction. The Weighty Isolation turned out to be too much for her, and she got drunk as she continued drinking.

After much long and arduous travel, Eachaejee and her friends finally reached the wretched realm of Sradom. The well-prepared party surveyed the army of Ijadlo Trothosrox the destroyer of worlds arrayed before them, but the fearsome sight did not drive them away. Though they felt great fear, our heroes knew that they needed to face the destroyer of worlds and put an end to the danger she posed to Shishou. Taking special care not to be seen, the party makes their way into the shadows to avoid being seen by the destroyer of worlds's army. The party made their way to the stronghold, but were spotted by a female orc who was about 6 feet and 8 inches tall and wore white leather armor with a blue-and-green loincloth and brown-and-black locks on her head. She ran to intercept the party and prevent them from continuing forward!

Looking about them to make sure they could hide better, the party moved on.
